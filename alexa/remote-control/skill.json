Simply start a session by saying 'Alexa remote control', then say the names of buttons you want Alexa to press. For example, say 'guide, down, right three times, enter'. You can also switch to another device. For example say 'Switch to Apple TV'. Note that Alexa will mute your TV while you provide button commands so you won't have to yell. To end your session just say 'done'."
